# Guess-the-Capital

In this final project, you will be deploying "Guess the Capital" on the cloud. It is a web application that asks you to guess the capital of a country from 4 choices.

You will use the source code and the steps provided to practice hands-on how an application can be developed and deployed on the cloud.

Objectives:
1)Clone the source code
2)Build Docker image
3)Deploy on Docker
4)Tag and Push image to IBM Cloud
5)Deploy on IBM Code Engine

Background
Docker
Containers are isolated environments that package applications and their dependencies. Each container runs as an isolated process on the host operating system.

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment and management of applications inside lightweight, isolated containers.

IBM Cloud
IBM Cloud is a cloud computing platform and suite of cloud-based services offered by IBM. It provides a range of infrastructure, platform, and software services to support the development, deployment, and management of various types of applications and workloads in the cloud.

IBM Code Engine
IBM Cloud Code Engine is a serverless compute platform provided by IBM Cloud. It allows developers to deploy and run containerized applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Abstracting away the complexities of server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, enabling developers to focus on writing code and building applications.

Working with files in Cloud IDE
If you are new to Cloud IDE, this section will show you how to create and edit files, which are part of your project, in Cloud IDE.

To view your files and directories inside Cloud IDE, click on this files icon to reveal it.

Files icon highlighted to reveal project directory

If you have cloned (using git clone command) boilerplate/starting code, then it will look like below:

Project directory showing boilerplate code

Otherwise a blank project looks like this:

Empty project directory

Create a new file
You can right-click and select the New File option to create a file in your project.

Create new file menu

You can also choose File -> New File to do the same.

It will then prompt you to enter name of this new file. In the example below, we are creating sample.html.

New file name

Clicking on the file name sample.html in the directory structure will open the file on the right pane. You can create all different types of files; for example FILE_NAME.js for JavaScript file.

Viewing sample file

In the example, we just pasted some basic html code and then saved the file.

Editing sample file

And saving it by:

Going in the menu.
Press унд + S on Mac or CTRL + S on Windows.
Or it can Autosave it for you too.
Save file menu


Verify the environment and command line tools
Open a terminal window by using the menu in the editor: Terminal > New Terminal.
Note:If the terminal is already opened, please skip this step.



Verify that docker CLI is installed.

You should see the following output, although the version may be different:


Start Code Engine
On the menu in your lab environment, Click on SN logo icon and then click the Cloud dropdown menu and select Code Engine. The code engine setup panel appears. Click Create Project to begin.

The code engine environment takes a while to prepare. You will see the progress status is indicated in the setup panel.

Code engine progress status show as preparing

Once the code engine set up is complete, you can see that it is active. Click Code Engine CLI to begin the pre-configured CLI in the terminal as shown below.

Code engine start CLI highlighted in red

You will observe that the pre-configured CLI startup and the home directory are set to the current directory. As a part of the pre-configuration, the project has been set up, and Kubeconfig is set up. The details are shown on the terminal as follows.

To test your application in your browser, run the application first. To view your application, click the Skills Network icon on the left panel (refer to number 1). This action will open the SKILLS NETWORK TOOLBOX. Next, click Launch Application (refer to number 2). Enter port number 8000 in Application Port (refer to number 3) and click . You can also click on the button given below to launch your application.



 Launch Application

It will look like this:

In your terminal, press CTRL + C to stop your web server.

Task 1: Containerise the application
Let's start modernising our application. The first step towards it is to containerise it using Docker.

Executed!
ibmcloud create command output

Take Cloud URL from the output; which looks something like: https://guess-the-capital.somerandomalphanumeric.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud and open in your browser.

Optionally check the status

1
ibmcloud ce application get --name guess-the-capital

Copied!
